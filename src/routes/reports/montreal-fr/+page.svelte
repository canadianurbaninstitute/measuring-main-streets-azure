		Vibrant main streets are essential to building strong neighbourhoods. Strong neighbourhoods are
		essential to healthy cities. And healthy cities are the foundation of a strong country.

		Over 4 million people live in the Montréal region, with 96% residing within 1 km of a main
		street. Montréal’s main streets are home to over 23,000 businesses that employ 215,000 people
		and generate over $30 billion in revenue per year. There are also nearly 8,000 sites of civic
		infrastructure on main streets.
	</p>
	<p>
		Main street businesses and civic infrastructure play a crucial role in the day-to-day lives of
		residents. But when main streets suffer, people suffer. The COVID-19 pandemic created
		significant pain on main streets, leading to the closure of businesses, and subsequently, to
		empty storefronts. While some main streets in the Montréal region have rebounded, many have not
		fully recovered.
	</p>
	<p>
		Our research shows that the <a href="/reports/mainstreet-resiliency"
			>most resilient main streets are those most closely aligned with their immediate local
			community</a
		>. Opportunities for independent business and neighbourhood scale civic infrastructure are key
		building blocks for pushing back against longer-term threats to main streets, such as
		<a href="reports/mainstreets-malls-mice">ecommerce and regional shopping centres.</a>
	</p>
	<p>
		Unfortunately, <a href="/reports/mainstreets-infrastructure-equity">
			community resources are not equitably distributed within urban regions</a
		>, including in the Montréal region. And, in more recently built suburban neighbourhoods that
		have not been developed around a main street, there is a scarcity of civic infrastructure. This
		research brief looks at main streets in relation to resiliency, community, and equity, drawing
		on 20 Montréal-region main street case studies.

			<h3>Montréal Case Study Main Streets</h3>
			<p>
				Twenty main streets were chosen in the Montréal region as representative case studies. Ten
				involved direct observational research and detailed data analysis, and ten provide the data
				component alone.
			</p>
			<p>The case studies were also contrasted with five regional shopping centres.</p>
			<p>
				In addition, we selected main streets that reflect a cross section of geographies, including
				four downtown (workplace oriented) streets, four small town main streets, and 12
				neighbourhood (residentially oriented) main streets.
			</p>
			<p>
				The presence of equity deserving communities was also a key factor in the selection process.

			<h3>Main Street Resiliency</h3>
			<p>
				While all Montréal-region main streets experienced serious downturns during the pandemic,
				some were hit harder and took longer to recover.
			</p>
			<p>
				Our <a href="/reports/mainstreet-resiliency">statistical analysis</a> shows that the most resilient
				main streets were those that draw a high proportion of their visitors from the immediate neighbourhood
				(within 1 km). Conversely, the least resilient main streets tended to draw a greater share of
				their visitors from further away.
			</p>
			<p>
				Main streets located in and near downtowns tended to be hit harder by the pandemic and took
				longer to recover. The second most important factor associated with resiliency during the
				pandemic was the presence of greenspace, as people sought out safe places where a degree of
				social interaction remained possible.
			</p>
			<p>
				Among all 20 Montréal-region main streets there were examples of small town, downtown, and
				residential streets demonstrating higher levels of resiliency. The most resilient main
				street case study was in <a href="/casestudies/montreal/ruestanne">Sainte Anne de Bellevue</a>, which had a high level of visitors (27%)
				coming from less than 1 km away. <a href="/casestudies/montreal/ruestpaul">Rue St. Paul</a> in Old Montréal is a rare example of a
				downtown main street that showed a higher degree of resilience. <a href="/casestudies/montreal/avedorval">Dorval</a> and <a href="/casestudies/montreal/boulevardmonk">Ville Emard
				(Boulevard Monk)</a> were the most resilient neighbourhood main street case studies in the
				Montréal region.
			</p>
			<p>
				<a href="/casestudies/montreal/stdenis">Saint Denis</a> and <a href="/casestudies/montreal/notredame">Notre Dame (Saint Henri)</a> were among the least resilient main street case
				studies in the Montréal region. Both tough the edges of the downtown core and rely on a
				greater share of visitor from more than 1km away. The least resilient neighbourhood case
				study main street was <a href="/casestudies/montreal/rueontario">Rue Ontario</a> in Hochelaga. It captured 20% of its visitors from with
				1km in 2019, which is at the low end of the spectrum for neighbourhood type main streets.

			<h3>Main Street Community</h3>
			<p>
				While the pandemic posed a major challenge to Montréal-region main streets, there are
				longer-term sources of strain that continue.
			</p>
			<p>
				<a href="/reports/mainstreets-malls-mice"
					>Regional shopping malls and ecommerce offer alternatives to many of the goods and
					services offered on main streets.</a
				> Shopping malls were initially hit harder by the pandemic due to the effects of hard lockdowns,
				but typically rebounded faster. The use of ecommerce spiked from 2020 to 2022 before returning
				to its (more modest) historic upward trend in 2023.
			</p>
			<p>
				Despite a degree of overlap between main streets and shopping malls and ecommerce, there are
				also significant differences. Main streets offer more opportunities for independent business
				and provide more civic infrastructure. Both can be more responsive to the specific needs of
				the local community, and the relationships forged through the interactions of residents,
				business operators, and managers of civic infrastructure are essential for the long-term
				vitality of main streets.
			</p>
			<p>
				The five Montréal-region shopping malls clearly have a scarcity of both independent
				businesses and civic infrastructure, ranking below all main streets on both scores. Of the
				Montréal case study main streets, <a href="/casestudies/montreal/boulevardmonk">Boulevard Monk (Ville Emard)
				</a>, <a href="/casestudies/montreal/ruestcharles">Rue Saint Charles (Old
				Longueil)</a>, and <a href="/casestudies/montreal/notredame">Rue Notre Dame (Saint Henri)</a> stand out as having higher shares of both
				independent business and civic infrastructure. Each of these are examples of main streets
				that are older well-established main streets that are dense and walkable. They possess a
				variety of building types that are generally flexible and adaptable. Two of the small-town
				main street case studies also scored in the top ten on both independent business and share
				civic infrastructure. <a href="/casestudies/montreal/ruestgeorge">Rue St. George (Saint Jerome)</a> and <a href="/casestudies/montreal/steustache"> Rue St. Eustache (St. Eustache)</a> both
				demonstrate assets that are conducive to centering strong local communities.
			</p>
			<p>
				<a href="/casestudies/montreal/avenuevictoria">Av. Victoria (St. Lambert)</a> and <a href="/casestudies/montreal/boulevardstmartin">Boul. St. Martin (Laval)</a> are main streets at the other end of
				the spectrum. These are places with less independent business and civic infrastructure that
				are heavily car-oriented and characterized by big box retail and chain restaurants. Such
				main streets do not possess a clear identity and are less likely to be shaped by the local
				community.

			<h3>Main Street Equity</h3>
			<p>
				Main streets contain the businesses and civic infrastructure that are essential for the
				day-to-day lives of residents. They make people’s lives better, easier, and more enjoyable –
				the foundation of local communities where people come together, interact, and form
				relationships.
			</p>
			<p>
				Unfortunately, not everyone enjoys equal access to main streets and what they have to offer.
				In some cases, main streets lack critical civic infrastructure, but more pointedly, some
				neighbourhoods lack main streets altogether. Our analysis shows that more recently built
				suburban neighbourhoods are where civic infrastructure deficits are most prevalent.
			</p>
			<p>
				Our Civic Infrastructure Index, which considers the amount of local (within 1 km) civic
				infrastructure relative to the local population, shows that Montréal-region more recently
				built neighbourhoods in places like Blainville, Laval, and Brossard tend to have lower
				levels of local access to civic infrastructure relative to the regional average.
			</p>
			<p>
				Downtown Montréal is at the other end of the spectrum, with much higher levels of civic
				infrastructure, as it is home to many regionally significant assets. Fittingly, <a href="/casestudies/montreal/notredame">Notre Dame (Saint Henri)</a> and <a href="/casestudies/montreal/stdenis">St. Denis</a> are the case studies that score the highest on our Civic
				Infrastructure Index. In the Montréal region, access to civic infrastructure tends to taper
				from the centre and so the neighbourhood main streets that score the highest on the index
				are relatively close to downtown. <a href="/casestudies/montreal/ruebeaubien">Rue Beaubien (Rosement-La-Petit-Patrie)</a> and <a href="/casestudies/montreal/rueontario">Rue Ontario
				(Hochelaga)</a> are prime examples of neighbourhood main streets with high levels of civic
				opportunity.
			</p>
			<p>
				The core issue not only about the overall amount of civic infrastructure, but how it is
				geographically distributed within urban regions. There is a danger of creating “have and
				have-not” neighbourhoods with divergent levels of local access to civic infrastructure,
				which in turn decreases the amount of control residents with less access to civic
				infrastructure have over programming. In such a scenario, civic infrastructure is less
				responsive to specific neighbourhood needs.
			</p>
			<p>
				The civic infrastructure deficit in recently constructed suburban neighbourhoods is not
				about the amount of investment, but rather models that favour large, centralized sites over
				smaller diffused locations. Like the trend toward big box retail in suburban environments,
				civic infrastructure provision has charted a similar path. These models may be more fiscally
				efficient in the short term, but they come with reduced community development and
				neighbourhood equity in the long term.

			<h3>Summary</h3>
			<p>
				Our research assesses main streets by their resiliency, community, and equity. We suggest
				that if the traits of specific main streets can foster these elements, they will nurture
				healthy neighbourhoods. If this is done consistently across Canada’s urban regions, they
				will provide the foundation for healthy cities.
			</p>
			<p>
				There is no such thing as a “perfect” main street. There are a multitude of ways in which
				they can produce resiliency, community, and equity. Our research does, however, point toward
				general principles about main street characteristics that are more likely to generate
				positive outcomes. We have created indicators that most closely capture the essence of these
				themes: a Resiliency Index based on the relative change in visitor levels to a main street
				through the pandemic and the share of visitors that live within 1 km of the main street; an
				Independent Business Index; and a Civic Infrastructure Index that weighs the amount of
				infrastructure relative to the size of the neighbourhood population.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Montréal region is a thriving metropolis that offers one of the highest quality of life
				environments compared to its global peers. The region has traditionally been credited with
				having strong neighbourhoods with distinct identities. At the centre of these neighbourhoods
				are vibrant main streets that provide a range of goods, services, and activities that
				support people in their day-to-day lives. No two main streets are the same, however; their
				specific locations and characteristics have significant impacts on the range of local
				choices and opportunities for residents.

			<h3>Summary (II)</h3>
			<p>
				The Montréal-region main street case studies that most consistently score the highest across
				the key indicators tend to be neighbourhood streets that are further from the city centre
				with a range of independent businesses and civic infrastructure. <a href="/casestudies/montreal/avedorval">Avenue Dorval</a>, <a href="/casestudies/montreal/boulevardmonk">Ville Emard
				(Boulevard Monk)</a>, <a href="/casestudies/montreal/boulevardstmartin">Boul. St. Martin (Laval)</a>, and <a href="/casestudies/montreal/jeantalon">Jean Talon (Parc-Extension)</a> are older
				suburban main streets that primarily serve their local communities. They also tend to offer
				a mix of housing types that cater to a range of income levels. These main streets were
				originally built (pre-1960) in conjunction with the surrounding housing stock and have
				co-evolved with physical and demographic changes. Key to this is the original built form and
				how adaptable it is over time. In the current context, such main streets offer prime
				opportunities for infill housing as they already provide ample supportive infrastructure.
			</p>
			<p>
				Montréal differs from the other case study regions of Toronto and Edmonton in overall urban
				form largely due to its relative age. Many of the main streets are older, and thus can be
				considered ‘traditional’ in the sense that they are highly walkable and provide fine grained
				retail. Cultural factors also likely contribute to Montréal having significantly higher
				levels of independent business. Long-term these factors are conducive to highly vibrant main
				streets, but in the short-term they may have contributed to Montréal being more negatively
				impacted by the pandemic, especially in areas closer to the centre. In addition to
				possessing an advantageous form, Montréal has also been at the fore of main street
				innovation. Imaginative use of the public realm and bolder pursuits of pedestrianization
				have received attention across the country. Many of these initiatives are now supported by
				data similar to what can be found on the Measuring Main Street platform.
